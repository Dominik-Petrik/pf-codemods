### avatar-replace-border-for-isBordered

[(#9881)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/9881)
[(#9954)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react/pull/9954)

`border` prop has been removed from Avatar since theming is not longer handled React-side. We recommend using the `isBordered` prop instead to add a border to Avatar.

#### Examples

In:

```jsx
%inputExample%
```

Out:

```jsx
%outputExample%
```
